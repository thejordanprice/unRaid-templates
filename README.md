# unRaid-templates
A repository of templates for docker containers that I have created for unRaid 6.6+. 

### Overview
I try to create packages that aren't already in existance. So if the software is available in this repo, I couldn't find it in the official repository OR in one that I felt had been updated recent enough.

You can ask for help [here](https://github.com/thejordanprice/unRaid-templates/issues/new) if you run into any bugs from the software inside.

### Usage
Add the following URL to the docker repositories field on the docker page inside the unRaid panel. Once saved, you should be able to pull the software from the repository.
